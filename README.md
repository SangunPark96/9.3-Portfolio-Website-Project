# 9.3-Pursuit-Portfolio-Project
This is my Js, CSS, and HTML Codes for my public news aggregator website. It is targeting the public NewsAPI to gather latest news headlines based on the users result.


While it is currently deployed on netlify with the domain https://clinquant-starlight-829cb6.netlify.app/, recent documentation has brought to light a change in NewsAPI's "free" developer liberties. To circumvent this I must either pay or do a number of things with flask on the back end but as that is outside of the scope of the cohort, I will just demonstrate the functionality locally. 


To use just load the page and immediately it will generate the top story at the moment on the left hand side of the page. On the right is a search form that will allow users to enter any particular topic and the page will generate the top 3 stories, as well as another image that allows the user to jump to the source article.

I plan on developing this further once we delve into the backend to then properly be able to secure API_keys, from the documentation i can read, it is impossible to deploy without actually creating our own backend. This will be an ongoing project that allows me to further develop my web dev skills.
